# Text_Adventure

the game is unfinished  

This is a small text adventure for my friends and me.  

I hope to add the following features:  
Boss (Evil Magic Kitan)  
Saving and Loading (warning currently only causing crashes)  
Items  
Chests  
Obstacles  

It would be great to change this from a text adventure to a game with a chess like map.  


To run this game:  
Ensure that python3 is installed on your PC  
Download zip and unzip it  
Open the Terminal and go to the folder with the game files
type python3 main.py
