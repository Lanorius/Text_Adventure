# Text_Adventure

the game is unfinished  

This is a small text adventure for my friends and me.  

I hope to add the following features:  
Boss (Evil Magic Lizard)  
Saving and Loading (warning currently only causing crashes)  
Items  
Chests  
Obstacles  

The game will also be available as an executable (exe) for windows.  
It would be great to change this from a text adventure to a game with a chess like map.  


To run this game:  
Ensure that python3 is installed on your PC  
Download zip and unzip it  
Open the Terminal and direct your directory to the folder with the game files  
type python3 main.py
